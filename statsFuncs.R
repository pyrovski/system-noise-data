#! @todo how to qualify peaks?
# - locations where the smoothed time series is X% higher than the median
#  - this tends to also raise nearby samples, but that's probably ok
#  - for an 11-element filter, use 10x higher than the median
# - locations where the original time series is X% higher than the median, with nearby samples smoothed together
